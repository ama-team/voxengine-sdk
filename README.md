# Unofficial VoxEngine SDK

This repository contains simple SDK to ease development of VoxImplant 
scenarios.

## ES5

This repository is developed as ES5 module because it is implied that 
built code would be injected directly in VoxImplant scenarios, which, in 
turn  do not support ES6 yet, and transpiling would dramatically harden
bug hunt.

## Todos

- Explicit documentation of library concepts and public interfaces
- More loggers
- More utilities
- Definition-based REST client?
